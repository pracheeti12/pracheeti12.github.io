  <p style="color:rgb(29, 29, 29);font-size:130%;">Hey there! I'm an 18 year old from north carolina who talks about life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness :)</p>
  <h1 style="color:rgb(29, 29, 29);font-size:130%;">&#127793 Currently.</h1>
  <p style="color:rgb(29, 29, 29);font-size:130%;">I'm learning about reinforcement learning in the context of robotics and image synthesis methods like generative adversial networks and diffusion models. 
    I'm also developing the hardware for a canine BCI device using functional near infrared spectroscopy for early disease detection in collaboration with a VC-backed startup. 
    I'm a creative at heart and am exploring the entrepreneurship ecosystem. 
    I believe solid fundamentals will be essential to my future endeavors, so I'm really taking the time to focus on my classes and settle into life at UC Berkeley.</p>

  <h1 style="color:rgb(29, 29, 29);font-size:130%;">&#9889 Previously.</h1>
  <p style="color:rgb(29, 29, 29);font-size:130%;">&#x2022; I led a team that made history at NASA. Designed the first commercial biopolymer aerogel, filed a patent, won an international competition, started a company, competed at NASA itech. It was fun.</p>
  <p style="color:rgb(29, 29, 29);font-size:130%;">&#x2022; Designed autonomous robots. Control systems, path following, motion-planning, kinematics, computer vision systems, that sort of thing.</p>
  <p style="color:rgb(29, 29, 29);font-size:130%;">&#x2022; I love teaching. I've been working with elementary-high school age kids for the past four years. I've mentored children in underprivileged communities, led the North Carolina Kode4Kids chapter, designed workshops & taught ML to girls across the globe through TechGirlz, and taught calculus at Kumon. </p>
  <p style="color:rgb(29, 29, 29);font-size:130%;">&#x2022; I published research in robotics control systems & conducted medical AI research at UNC Chapel Hill </p>  
  <p style="color:rgb(29, 29, 29);font-size:130%;">&#x2022; I interned at a fintech startup. Got me interested in secure payment platforms and startup lifecycles. </p>  

  <h1 style="color:rgb(29, 29, 29);font-size:130%;">&#127756 Bits & Atoms.</h1>
  <p style="color:rgb(29, 29, 29);font-size:130%;">
    I'm interested in so many things. Machine learning, device engineering, philosophy, quantum computing, particle physics, astrophysics, computational imaging, robotics, protein folding, nanotechnology, probability theory, economics, venture capital. I imagine one day to have some level of expertise in all of these. 
    I'm excited by the unconventional, and I want to be a part of extraordinary teams fueled by visions that defy societal norms.  
    I want to keep meeting new people and exploring new places.
    I'm not afraid of stagnation, sometimes you need that in life to find your next breakthrough. What I'm afraid of is being bored. So, I'm always pushing forward. Game on.</p>

    <p style="color:rgb(29, 29, 29);font-size:130%;">I'm a fan of Avatar the Last Airbender, mocha, and Jane Austen novels. Catch me at berkeley coffee shops &#9749 or exploring SF &#127745</p>
    <p style="color:rgb(29, 29, 29);font-size:130%;">Reach out to me. I'm always willing to talk about ideas, thoughts, or my hot takes on the origin of human civilization.</p>
